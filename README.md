## Overview

This repository is a research project for working with ontologies with Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) algorithms.

This project contains both `Julia` and `Python` experiments, so typical project structures for these languages are overlapping in this repository.
This generally does not result in software collision, but this is noted here to clarify any confusion that could arise from this to the reader.

## Links

This section contains several categories of links to useful resources when working with ontologies and the programming techniques of this research project.
