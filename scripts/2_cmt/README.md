# 2_cmt

This experiment runs the GramART method on parsed statements from a medical knowledge graph of the Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease.

## Guide

This experiment is implemented with the following steps:

1. `kgcmt.py`: Python script that generates `edge_attributes_lerche.txt` in `work/results/2_cmt/`.
2. `cmt_gramart.jl`: Julia script that parses the statements into structured trees and a corresponding grammar and then clusters those statements with GramART.

## Files

All of the files in this experiment are itemized with descriptions below.
Note that not all files are used in the experiment as some files are maintained for historical reasons.

- `cmt_gramar.jl`: the primary Julia experiment file, parsing the statements generated by `kgcmt.py` and clustering them with GramART.
- `knowledge_graph_cmt_orig.py`: Dr. Hier's original script generating `node_attributes.txt`, `edge_attributes.txt`, and `OWL` files from the CMT OMIM data.
- `knowledge_graph_cmt_simple.py`: Dr. Hier's original script implementing a simple knowledge graph and ontology for visualization.
- `kgcmt.py`: A modification of `knowledge_graph_cmt_orig.py`, used for generating `edge_attributes_lerche.txt` for parsing in Julia with Lerche.jl.
- `README.md`: this document.
- `utils.py`: A collection of Python utility definitions and functions for the Python experiments withint his folder
