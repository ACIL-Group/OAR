# 0_init

This folder contains startup scripts and development files for the `OAR` project.
Due to being an informal development location, it is constantly in flux, and files within will change as the needs of the project progress.

Loosely, this folder contains scripts for the development of:

- `DrWatson.jl` extensions specific to this project.
- `Lerche.jl` grammars.
- Non-`Lerch.jl` custom grammar data definitions using Extended Bachus-Naur forms production rules.
- Transforming real-valued datasets like the Iris dataset into symbolic approximate representations.
- Grammar symbol definitions and Julia types that implement the above.
